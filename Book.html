                    <p>#1 New York Times Bestseller
                      Over 6 million copies sold.
                      In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how 
                      to stop trying to be "positive" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.<br>
                      For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "F**k positivity,
                      " Mark Manson says. "Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular 
                      Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, 
                      honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, 
                      let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold 
                      medals just for showing up.<br>
                      Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives 
                      hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings 
                      are flawed and limited—"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of 
                      it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace 
                      our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we 
                      can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.<br>
                      There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson 
                      makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about 
                      experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with 
                      entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a 
                      generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.</p>

                        cognitive psychology, Henrik Fexeus explains how readers can find out what another person feels - and consequently control 
                        that individual's thoughts and beliefs.<br>
                        Short, snappy chapters cover subjects like:<br>
                        Contradictory signs and what they mean<br>
                        How you flirt with people without even knowing it<br>
                        Methods of suggestion and undetectable influence<br>
                        How to plant and trigger emotional states<br>
                        Fexeus offers practical tips to master the art of persuasion, which will boost your confidence both in personal and 
                        professional settings. Simple exercises throughout the book will heighten your self-awareness, revealing how you are 
                        perceived by others. Whether you want to get a promotion, negotiate a pay rise, network like a pro, find romance or spot 
                        when someone is lying, The Art of Reading Minds shows you how to uncover what people are really saying.</p>

            <p>Originally published in Swedish in 2014 as Omgiven Av Idioter, Erikson's Surrounded by Idiots is already an 
                international phenomenon, selling over 1.5 million copies worldwide, of which over 750,000 copies have been sold 
                in Sweden alone. It offers a simple, yet ground-breaking method for assessing the personalities of people we 
                communicate with - in and out of the office - based on four personality types (Red, Blue, Green and Yellow), and 
                provides insights into how we can adjust the way(s) we speak and share information.<br>
                Erikson will help you understand yourself better, hone communication and social skills, handle conflict with 
                confidence, improve dynamics with your boss and team, and get the best out of the people you deal with and manage. 
                He also shares simple tricks on body language, improving written communication and advice on when to back away or 
                when to push on, and when to speak up or indeed shut up. Packed with 'aha!' and 'oh no!' moments, Surrounded by Idiots 
                will help you understand and influence those around you, even people you currently think are beyond all comprehension.<br>
                And with a bit of luck you can also be confident that the idiot out there isn't you!</p>
