                      <p>#1 New York Times Bestseller
                        Over 6 million copies sold.
                        In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how 
                        to stop trying to be "positive" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.<br>
                        For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "F**k positivity,
                        " Mark Manson says. "Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular 
                        Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, 
                        honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, 
                        let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold 
                        medals just for showing up.<br>
                        Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives 
                        hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings 
                        are flawed and limited—"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of 
                        it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace 
                        our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we 
                        can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.<br>
                        There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson 
                        makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about 
                        experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with 
                        entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a 
                        generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.</p>

                    <p>From the bestselling author of The Everything Store, an unvarnished picture of Amazon’s unprecedented growth and its 
                      billionaire founder, Jeff Bezos, revealing the most important business story of our time.<br>
                      “If a company and a culture can have a biographer, Stone is Amazon’s—which, given the retailer’s ubiquity, makes him a 
                      biographer of the way all of us live now.” —Jon Meacham, Pulitzer Prize winner and New York Times bestselling author
                      Almost ten years ago, Bloomberg journalist Brad Stone captured the rise of Amazon in his bestseller The Everything Store. <br>
                      Since then, Amazon has expanded exponentially, inventing novel products like Alexa and disrupting countless industries, 
                      while its workforce has quintupled in size and its valuation has soared to well over a trillion dollars. Jeff Bezos’s 
                      empire, once housed in a garage, now spans the globe. Between services like Whole Foods, Prime Video, and Amazon’s cloud 
                      computing unit, AWS, plus Bezos’s ownership of The Washington Post, it’s impossible to go a day without encountering its 
                      impact. We live in a world run, supplied, and controlled by Amazon and its iconoclast founder.<br>
                      In Amazon Unbound, Brad Stone presents a deeply reported, vividly drawn portrait of how a retail upstart became one of the 
                      most powerful and feared entities in the global economy. Stone also probes the evolution of Bezos himself—who started as a 
                      geeky technologist totally devoted to building Amazon, but who transformed to become a fit, disciplined billionaire with 
                      global ambitions; who ruled Amazon with an iron fist, even as he found his personal life splashed over the tabloids.
                      Definitive, timely, and revelatory, Stone has provided an unvarnished portrait of a man and company that we couldn’t imagine 
                      modern life without.</p>

                    <p>'Essential for any leader in any industry' – Kim Scott, bestselling author of Radical Candor<br>
                      Working Backwards gives an insider's account of Amazon's approach to culture, leadership, and best practices 
                      from two long-time, top-level Amazon executives.<br>
                      In 2018 Amazon became the world’s second trillion dollar company after Apple: a remarkable success story for a 
                      company launched out of a garage in 1994. How did they achieve this? And how can others learn from this extraordinary 
                      success and replicate it?<br>
                      Colin Bryar started at Amazon in 1998; Bill Carr joined in 1999. Their time at Amazon covered a period of unmatched 
                      innovation that brought products and services including Kindle, Amazon Prime, Amazon Echo and Alexa, and Amazon Web 
                      Services to life. Through the story of these innovations they reveal and codify the principles and practices that have 
                      driven the success of one of the most extraordinary companies the world has ever known, from the famous 14-leadership 
                      principles, the bar raiser hiring process, and Amazon’s founding characteristics: customer obsession, long-term thinking, 
                      eagerness to invent, and operational excellence.<br>
                      Through their wealth of experience they offer unprecedented access to the Amazon way as it was refined, articulated, and 
                      proven to be repeatable, scalable, and adaptable. Working Backwards shows how success is not achieved by the genius of any 
                      single leader, but rather through commitment to and execution of a set of well-defined, rigorously-executed principles and 
                      practices that you can apply at your own company, no matter the size.</p>

                    <p>The CEO of Disney, one of Time’s most influential people of 2019, shares the ideas and values he embraced to reinvent one of the most beloved 
                      companies in the world and inspire the people who bring the magic to life.<br>
                      Robert Iger became CEO of The Walt Disney Company in 2005, during a difficult time. Morale had deteriorated, competition was intense, and technology 
                      was changing faster than at any time in the company’s history. His vision came down to three clear ideas: Recommit to the concept that quality matters, 
                      embrace technology instead of fighting it, and think bigger―think global―and turn Disney into a stronger brand in international markets.<br>
                      In The Ride of a Lifetime, Robert Iger shares the lessons he’s learned while running Disney and leading its 200,000 employees, and he explores the principles 
                      that are necessary for true leadership, including:<br>
                      <strong>Optimism.</strong> Even in the face of difficulty, an optimistic leader will find the path toward the best possible outcome and focus on that, rather than give in 
                      to pessimism and blaming.<br>
                      <strong>Courage.</strong> Leaders have to be willing to take risks and place big bets. Fear of failure destroys creativity.<br>
                      <strong>Decisiveness.</strong> All decisions, no matter how difficult, can be made on a timely basis. Indecisiveness is both wasteful and destructive to morale.<br>
                      <strong>Fairness.</strong> Treat people decently, with empathy, and be accessible to them.</p>

                  <p>When Jennifer Doudna was in sixth grade, she came home one day to find that her dad had left a paperback titled The Double Helix on her bed. 
                    She put it aside, thinking it was one of those detective tales she loved. When she read it on a rainy Saturday, she discovered she was right, in a 
                    way. As she sped through the pages, she became enthralled by the intense drama behind the competition to discover the code of life. Even though her 
                    high school counselor told her girls didn’t become scientists, she decided she would.<br>
                    Driven by a passion to understand how nature works and to turn discoveries into inventions, she would help to make what the book’s author, James Watson, 
                    told her was the most important biological advance since his codiscovery of the structure of DNA. She and her collaborators turned a curiosity of nature 
                    into an invention that will transform the human race: an easy-to-use tool that can edit DNA. Known as CRISPR, it opened a brave new world of medical 
                    miracles and moral questions.<br>
                    The development of CRISPR and the race to create vaccines for coronavirus will hasten our transition to the next great innovation revolution. The past 
                    half-century has been a digital age, based on the microchip, computer, and internet. Now we are entering a life-science revolution. Children who study 
                    digital coding will be joined by those who study genetic code.<br>
                    Should we use our new evolution-hacking powers to make us less susceptible to viruses? What a wonderful boon that would be! And what about preventing 
                    depression? Hmmm…Should we allow parents, if they can afford it, to enhance the height or muscles or IQ of their kids?<br>
                    After helping to discover CRISPR, Doudna became a leader in wrestling with these moral issues and, with her collaborator Emmanuelle Charpentier, won the 
                    Nobel Prize in 2020. Her story is an “enthralling detective story” (Oprah Daily) that involves the most profound wonders of nature, from the origins of 
                    life to the future of our species.</p>

                  <p><strong>‘Noise may be the most important book I've read in more than a decade. A genuinely new idea so exceedingly important you will immediately put it into 
                    practice. A masterpiece’ <br>
                    Angela Duckworth, author of Grit<br>
                    ‘An absolutely brilliant investigation of a massive societal problem that has been hiding in plain sight’
                    Steven Levitt, co-author of Freakonomics<br>
                    From the world-leaders in strategic thinking and the multi-million copy bestselling authors of Thinking Fast and Slow and Nudge, the next big book to 
                    change the way you think.</strong><br>
                    Imagine that two doctors in the same city give different diagnoses to identical patients – or that two judges in the same court give different sentences 
                    to people who have committed matching crimes. Now imagine that the same doctor and the same judge make different decisions depending on whether it is 
                    morning or afternoon, or Monday rather than Wednesday, or they haven’t yet had lunch. These are examples of noise: variability in judgements that should 
                    be identical.<br>
                    In Noise, Daniel Kahneman, Olivier Sibony and Cass R. Sunstein show how noise produces errors in many fields, including in medicine, law, public health, 
                    economic forecasting, forensic science, child protection, creative strategy, performance review and hiring. And although noise can be found wherever people 
                    are making judgements and decisions, individuals and organizations alike commonly ignore its impact, at great cost.<br>
                    Packed with new ideas, and drawing on the same kind of sharp analysis and breadth of case study that made Thinking, Fast and Slow and Nudge international 
                    bestsellers, Noise explains how and why humans are so susceptible to noise and bias in decision-making. We all make bad judgements more than we think. With 
                    a few simple remedies, this groundbreaking book explores what we can do to make better ones.</p>
